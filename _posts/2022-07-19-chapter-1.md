# Chapter 1

The fog was so thick and dense that, apart from a few buildings a few meters away, no-one would have any idea what was going on. For all you knew, the entire earth could have collapsed into itself without making any noise (not with a bang, but a whisper, remember?), leaving behind a tiny island spanning a few meters on which you stand. Walking a little bit forward, you would have seen the dirt road suddenly stop, and your next minutes, hours, or even days, would have been spent wondering where everything has gone and what the hell you were going to do. Tracing the edge of the cliff, desperately trying to find a sort of bridge to find a way out, you would have come to realize that there's nobody left, just you, left to die on this cursed rock.\
After a while, trying to pass the time, you would have taken a moment to examine your own body. Your legs, which no longer have a purpose, seeing how you can't really go anywhere, would come right off like boiled meat when you would glide over them with your hand. Moving on, your abdomen and torso would turn to mush, and you would find it amusing how you don't feel any pain. Finishing off, rubbing your head, you would find that your scalp came right off, and you're now scrambling your own brain, which now seems like the only evidence that anything ever existed. Realizing that you're now tampering with evidence, you would laugh, then try to fall asleep.\
Sure, this small island has a little bit of grass and dirt, as well as a small stretch of metal fence, but there once was more to it. Just a few steps forward, there once was a yellow, abandoned house with two floors. Walking up the road, trying to reach the gate, you would see the house's front side, with a small set of concrete stairs that lead to a small, white front door. A little on the right, you would see a small terrace attached to a house, with a couple of wooden benches next to a long table. A small black pot, filled with burnt wood and with a small grill placed over it, was sitting under one of the benches. Although lighting up a fire would help against the cold and bitter air, there's nothing nearby that you could use to do so.\
A black woodshed was attached to the house, filled with old furniture and souvenirs stolen from your even foggier childhood. Old CDs, plush toys and dirty pictures that look at you strangely, expecting for you to remember them. However, as much as you try, you can't even recall why you're there, leave alone anything that happened ages ago.
